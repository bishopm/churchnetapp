POWER TO ADD USERS

Users with admin level 1,2,3,4 may add users and give them up to and including the same levels of user power as they have

They may also give them admin or editor powers in respect of any societies, circuits, districts (or children) which they have access to.

eg: Level 3 (Circuit) admin can create more level 3 users (or level 4 users)

Level 3 admin can give such users admin or editor rights in circuit as well as admin or editor rights in any societies in that circuit

Implications:

1. On the users page, only display users in the districts, circuits, societies I have admin rights to.
2. When adding a user, only allow me to add rights up to mine and access up to mine.
3. When editing a user, only allow me to add societies, circuits, districts I have admin rights to

Regarding user access:

Circuit admins can:

- approve new societies, services or edit society details
- change circuit officers 
- change settings

Circuit editors can:
- edit the preaching plan

Society admins:

Society editors:
